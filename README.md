## Summary <a name="summary"></a>
The research project proposes an ["**AttendanceKit: ...**"](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-981-19-8069-5_29) system that uses real-time **Ultra-High Frequency (UHF) RFID** and **NFC** technology combined with **face recognition** to automatically check students' attendance in offline classes, packaged as a suite of mobile applications for *Institution*, *Lecturers* and *Students* to overcoming the disadvantages of manual inspection.

<img align="middle" width="1000" src="https://github.com/verny-tran/AttendanceKit/blob/main/Resources/Figures/Attendance%20checking%20flow.png">

The backend system will send **real-time notifications** to students' mobile devices, allowing them to verify attendance. It also features *attendance monitoring*, allowing instructors to evaluate student status. The system can also **compile reports** on student learning status, providing insights for lecturers, parents, and institutions.

The diagram depicted above demonstrates the procedural flow of the **Custom Admin Module**, which addresses [Firebase Authentication](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth)'s limitation by allowing one **end-user** (*Institution*) to create accounts for **other end-users** (*Student*) using a [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) module of custom functions.

Our system also takes **time and accuracy** into account. In addition, the results present a complete performance study of the system with [RFID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio-frequency_identification), [NFC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Near-field_communication) and genuine mobile devices, as well as a novel machine learning platform that *can be deployed on actual devices* in reality for commercial.

And also the article ["**To Wrap, or Not to Wrap: ...**"](https://doi.org/10.1007/s42979-023-02185-2) explores the implementation approaches of face recognition models on mobile devices, focusing on their performance and precision. It explores the advantages and disadvantages of the [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org) and [Core ML](https://developer.apple.com/machine-learning/core-ml) model encoding approach, and its impact on the overall success of the **AttendanceKit** system.

__Contribution of this work:__
- A set of **macOS** and **iOS** role-based attendance checking usable and deployable applications for Apple platforms.
- Assess the performance of the learning outcomes to illustrate the utility of **automatic RFID, NFC** in improving the quality of learning.
- Custom **admin module** to modify the behavior of **Firebase Authentication**, allows an end-user to create accounts for other end-users.
- Algorithms fed with a series of **5-second-long videos** containing the face samples of students and and how to optimize the recognition process in real-time on mobile devices's camera.
- Leverage the CNN **FaceNet** model, implemented in **TensorFlow's** and how to convert to the native **Core ML** `.mlmodel` format prior. Examining the approaches of **Create ML**, **turicreate** and **coremltools**.
- Determined timing and precision by comparing the analysis on the two mobile platforms, and the benefits and drawbacks of each model implementation method (**native framework**, **web API**, **model wrapping**, or **model converting**) to have a clear picture of which strategy to employ for similar systems.

## Applications <a name="applications"></a>
There are many items in the **AttendanceKit** set of applications, including: **Student**, **Institution**, **Lecturer** (iOS), and **RFID Dashboard** (macOS).

|     Student    |   Institution  |    Lecturer    | RFID Dashboard |
|      :---:     |      :---:     |      :---:     |      :---:     |

| Face recognition is used as biometric security for all students when checking attendance. | To collect student face samples, class scheduling, assign tags, and classrooms. | For lecturers to view attendance reports and change schedules. | For connecting to RFID antennas to read and display tag IDs, act as admin application to compose notifications for mobile devices. |

## Inspiration <a name="inspiration"></a>
The **face recognition module** of these applications is heavily inspired by the project [**enVision**](https://github.com/IDLabs-Gate/enVision) from [ID Labs](https://github.com/IDLabs-Gate).

To create the `AttendanceKit.xcworkspace`, run the following commands in **Terminal**. Replace `<project_folder>` with your cloned project root folder:
```bash
$ cd /Users/<project_folder>
$ pod install
```

### Gradle
The macOS **RFID Dashboard** application uses [Gradle](https://gradle.org) as it's project build automation tool. Refresh the dependencies of the `dashboard.idea` project by running the following command:

```bash
$ gradle --refresh-dependencies clean build
```

## Directory structure <a name="directory"></a>

__NOTE:__ If you use any of the models, please do not forget to give proper credit to me, the [FaceNet](https://github.com/davidsandberg/facenet) authors and those providing the training dataset as well.

## Training data <a name="training"></a>
The [CASIA-WebFace](http://www.cbsr.ia.ac.cn/english/CASIA-WebFace-Database.html) dataset has been used for training. This training set consists of total of **453.453** images over **10.575** identities after face detection. Some performance improvement has been seen if the dataset has been filtered before training. Some more information about how this was done will come later.
The best performing model has been trained on the [VGGFace2](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/vgg_face2/) dataset consisting of ~**3.3M** faces and ~**9.000** classes.

## Performance <a name="performance"></a>
The accuracy on LFW for the model [facenet.pb](https://github.com/verny-tran/AttendanceKit/blob/main/Resources/Models/facenet.pb) is `0.99650Â±0.00252`. A description of how to run the test can be found on the page [Validate on LFW](https://github.com/davidsandberg/facenet/wiki/Validate-on-lfw). 

__NOTE:__ The input images to the model need to be standardized using fixed image standardization (use the option `--use_fixed_image_standardization` when running e.g. `validate_on_lfw.py`).
